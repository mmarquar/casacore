\chapter{Miscellaneous Duties}
\section{ClearDDTS}
We use ClearDDTS as our defect tracking system.  There is fairly extensive
written and web base documentation for the administrator.  ClearDDTs defects
reside in /users/ddts and is licensed to run on tarzan. A cron job runs four
times a day looking for lost defects.
\section{Linkscan}
We use linkscan software to scan the AIPS++ web pages for broken and missing
links.  As aips2mgr on tarzan; cd /home/tarzan/httpd/linkscan; ./linkscan.pl.
Once the script has run it produces a series of reports that can be accessed
at http://aips2.nrao.edu/linkscan.

Configuration scripts for linkscan are found in
/home/tarzan/httpd/linkscan/default and userdoc.  Default is setup to scan the
entire aips++ web site, where userdoc will scan only the release doc tree.
\section{Htdig}
Htdig provides the search engine for the AIPS++ site.  Several cron jobs 
(run as wyoung) 
on tarzan that scan the AIPS++ code and docs tree.  Configuration files are found
in /aips++/local/htdig-3.1/conf.  Details on the care and feeding of htdig maybe
found at it's web site http://www.htdig.org.

\section{Email}
Several email aliases are maintained on tarzan in /etc/mail/tarzan.aliases-tail.
The aliases are update once a day around 0300 and require root privileges to 
make any changes.

We use mailman 
(maintained in Charlottesville) to handle the mailing lists although messages are
sent to local aips++ logs in /export/aips++/Mail on tarzan.
