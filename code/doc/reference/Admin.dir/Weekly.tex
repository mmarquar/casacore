\chapter{Weekly Duties}
\section{Check for stable}
Every Friday we do a cumulative build on all architectures.  These build constitute the stable
candidate.  The criteria for a stable are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Must be a cumulative
\item All aips unit tests should pass. Tests may fail but the failure must be understood and
considered to be minor (i.e. similar to tDirectory failure on linux with NFS mounts).
\item assay().trytests() runs without failure.
\item dishlongtests() runs without failure.
\item no obvious failures in loading the help atoms
\end{enumerate}
So what does this entail?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Examine build logs for glaring problems. 
\item Look at the unit tests
\begin{enumerate}
\item{linux\_gnu}
\item{sun4sol\_gnu}
\item{sun4sol\_ntv}
\end{enumerate}
\item Run assay
\begin{enumerate}
\item{linux\_gnu}
\item{sun4sol\_gnu}
\item{sun4sol\_ntv}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
If the build is "stable", then as aips2adm on tarzan
\begin{enumerate}
\item Send an email to aips2-naug aips2-aoc warning of the impending build
\begin{verbatim}
Greetings,

Build xx.yyy has met the stable criteria.  We will begin building the new stable @hhmm MT.
Please use weekly until the new stable has completed.

aips2mgr

\end{verbatim}
\item as aips2adm; cd /export/aips++/scripts; sh ./do\_blessing xx.yyy
This scripts marks xx.yyy as stable; inhales the stable into /aips++/stable; and begins the stable
build for linux and solaris.  The local sgi stable build is triggered by it's own cron job.
\item Send an email to aips2-sitemgr
\begin{verbatim}
Greetings,

Build xx.yyy has been declared stable.  Please update your stable releases.

aips2mgr
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Stables should be declared no later than Monday afternoon if at all possible, so remote sites can
inhale the latest stable Monday evening.
