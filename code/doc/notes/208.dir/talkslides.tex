\begin{slide}{What is AIPS++ and why are we doing it?}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Consortium} of radio observatories, building package
to handle processing for new telescopes, and improved processing
for existing telescopes.
\item Deliberate pooling of effort inside NRAO and across
observatories
\item All observatories facing same problem of old packages
leading to user dissatisfaction, and limited technical
development:
\begin{itemize}
\item Need better tools for end-user, improved interfaces,
and new packages
\item Astronomers need to be able to program at {\em e.g.}
IDL-type level
\item Programmers need richer set of tools and packages to
work with
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
\item[Data] Uniform access to data
\item[Tools] General operations, array math, FFTs, fitting, plotting,
display, {\em etc.}
\item[Tasks] Applications for doing radio-astronomy {\em e.g.}
processing of data from radio-telescopes, both single dishs and
synthesis arrays

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Beta release 0.8}

\begin{itemize}
\item Announced on February 26 1997. 
\item All consortium sites, and Caltech, University of Iowa, Kapteyn
Astronomical Institute, and the National Optical Astronomy
Observatory. 
\item Most feedback on the beta release is conducted either via the AIPS++
Bug Tracking system or or via an e-mail exploder. A fair amount also
via private e-mail.
\item The responses to beta release can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Installation seems relatively straightforward apart from some
difficulties with shared libraries.
\item Configuration does not require much work.
\item The initial verification of the system via an assay function
seems to have gone straightforwardly.
\item The documentation seems comprehensive but hard-to-understand.
Some of the OO terminology is either not explained well or has crept
into places where it is not wanted.  Testers have found a
(not-unexpected) number of errors in documentation.
\item The user interface is viewed as overly verbose and unfriendly.
\item The synthesis code is viewed as being powerful but hard to
master.
\item The synthesis code is slow and subject to memory
bloat in some circumstances.
\item There have been a number of bugs, perhaps slightly more in code
written in Glish (as opposed to C++).
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{What's available in Beta Release (0.8)?}
\begin{itemize}
\item AIPS++ has a powerful command line interpreter called Glish.
\item AIPS++ has a number of general purpose tools that are accessible
from Glish.
\begin{itemize}
\item Access to all data in AIPS++ via the table module.
\item Catalogs of directories, interpreting the contents to show 
different types of files, and catalogs of potentially everything in Glish
({\em i.e.} functions and variables).
\item Plotting of Glish variables.
\item Assorted mathematical capabilities such as 
statistics, random numbers, polynomial fitting, interpolation,
Fast Fourier Transforms and convolutions.
\item Manipulation of measured quantities with units and reference
frames either from the Glish command line or via a gui.
\item Display of AIPS++ or FITS images or Glish arrays using the
aipsview program.
\item Conversion of images to and from FITS image format, 
reading and writing AIPS++ images to and from Glish. Statistics, histograms and 
moments of images may be calculated. Subimaging and padding are both allowed.
\item Logging of messages to a gui window and a table, also printing
to a postscript printer or to ghostview.
\item Miscellaneous useful utilities including: obtaining AIPS++ 
configuration information, the help utility, 
a printer tool (including a gui), execution of shell commands, reading and 
writing to external files using C-like commands, {\em etc.}
\end{itemize}
\item The synthesis capabilities of AIPS++ are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filling from and writing to a UVFITS file,
\item Filling from WSRT format,
\item Full imaging, deconvolution, and self-calibration,
\item Joint deconvolution of Stokes IQUV,
\item Robust, uniform and natural weighting,
\item Flexible windowing in the deconvolution,
\item Non-Negative Least Squares Deconvolution,
\item Flexible construction of models for self-calibration,
\item A sophisticated multi-component model for gain effects,
\item Interactive editing,
\item Flagging of gain solutions by antenna, spectral window, and
time interval.
\item Writing of final images to FITS files.
\end{itemize}
\item All user capabilities of AIPS++ are documented via the
AIPS++ User Reference Manual
and on-line help is available from the command line.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Goals for Synthesis Processing in AIPS++}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gleaned from the 1992 User Specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow all important and hopefully most extant calibration and imaging
schemes to be coded in AIPS++,
\item Allow observatories to develop custom calibration and imaging
packages,
\item Allow a programmer to add new calibration and deconvolution algorithms
as easily and naturally as possible,
\item Allow future instruments (such as the NRAO MMA and the SKAI) to be 
supported in AIPS++,
\item Support as standard observing: mosaiced, spectral-line, multi-feed, 
polarization observations with synthesis arrays and single dishs,
\item Allow calibration and imaging algorithms to be used as
part of higher level algorithms,
\item Acheive performance goals that will allow the calibration and
imaging system to be used for standard production processing.
\end{itemize}
\item Ambitious set of goals
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Review of Synthesis Calibration and Imaging}
\begin{itemize}
\item Interferometric arrays measure the Fourier transform of the
Sky Brightness:
\begin{equation}
V(u,v) = \int I(x,y) e^{j 2\pi \left(u.x+v.y\right)} dx dy
\end{equation}
\item Only sampled at limited number of discrete points
\item Typically corrupted by antenna-based calibration errors:
\begin{equation}
V_{i,j}(u,v) = g_i g_j^* \int I(x,y) e^{j 2\pi \left(u.x+v.y\right)} dx dy
\end{equation}
\item Calibration and imaging in radio-interferometry corresponds to
solving for the calibration parameters $g$ and the sky brightness $I$.
\item Many special cases where equation must be modified:
\begin{itemize}
\item Wide fields: not a simple 2-D transform
\item Wide fields: power receptivity patterns limits field of view, need to
mosaic, also single dish observations
\item Wide fields: bandwidth and time-averaging smearing
\item Polarized radiation: more terms
\end{itemize}
\item {\em Goal of AIPS++ synthesis processing is to do all cases, special and
ordinary (eventually!)}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}{The Measurement Equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to generalise? Especially for polarization measurements? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each antenna measures two polarizations: either Right and Left
Hand Circular or X and Y Linear. 
\item Form all correlations {\em e.g.} $RR, RL, LR, LL$
\item Image Stokes $I,Q,U,V$
\item Correct for gains and leakages ({\em e.g.} $R$ to $L$ and vice versa)
\end{itemize}
\item The Hamaker-Bregman-Sault Measurement Equation is expressed in direct 
products of 2 by 2 matrices (Jones Matrices) representing the
antenna-based calibration effects, and 4 vectors representing the
measured coherence and sky brightness:
\begin{equation}
\vvCoh\ssIJ = \xfnCorr\ssIJ \left(\mmMifr\ssIJ \visterm{\mjVisJones} 
\sum_k \skykterm{\mjSkyJones} \mmStokes \ \vvIQUV_k + \vvAifr\ssIJ \right)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{description}
\item[$\vvCoh$] is the 4 vector of coherences {\em e.g.} RR, RL, LR, LL
\item[$\xfnCorr$] is the non-linear correlator response function
\item[$\mmMifr$] represents correlator-based gain errors
\item[$\mjVisJones$] represents antenna-based and non-direction dependent
gain effects,
\item[$\mjSkyJones$] represents antenna-based and direction dependent
gain effects ({\em including the Fourier transform phase factors}).
\item[$\mmStokes$] is a 4 by 4 matrix to convert Stokes $I,Q,U,V$ to 
polarization {\em e.g.} $RR,RL,LR,LL$
\item[$\vvIQUV_k$] is the 4 vector of Stokes $I,Q,U,V$ for pixel $k$
\item[$\vvAifr$] is an additive error per coherence sample.
\end{description}
\item Specializes to the usual Fourier transform equation
\item We need to be able to do the following things:
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate predicted coherences $\vvCoh\ssIJ$ if given all terms on right 
hand side,
\item Given observed coherences, construct an image of the Sky Brightness,
\item Solve for other terms on right hand side given observed coherences and
a model for the sky brightness.
\end{itemize}
\item By suitable choices of the components can do all the special
cases.
\item Better to split into separate Sky and Vis Equations:
\begin{equation}
\vvCoh^{Sky}\ssIJ = \sum_k \skykterm{\mjSkyJones} \mmStokes \ \vvIQUV_k 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\vvCoh\ssIJ = \xfnCorr\ssIJ \left(\mmMifr\ssIJ \visterm{\mjVisJones} 
\vvCoh^{sky}\ssIJ + \vvAifr\ssIJ \right)
\end{equation}
\item {\em Generalized Self-calibration Equations}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
