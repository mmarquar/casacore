This code is a subset of the MIRIAD I/O library. The MIRIAD package is a package
developed for BIMA and actively being used by BIMA and ATNF for their offline
calibration and data reduction needs.

More details on the MIRIAD package can be found on:

	http://bima.astro.umd.edu/bima/miriad/
or	http://www.atnf.csiro.au/Software/Analysis/miriad/

Although the BIMA and ATNF versions use a slightly different directory
structure (January 1997), the source code is the same. You should be
able to find all subroutines in $MIR/src/sub, except for miriad.h, which
was specifically generated for the AIPS++ project.

Most of the low level C code was developed by Bob Sault (rsault@atnf.csiro.au).
