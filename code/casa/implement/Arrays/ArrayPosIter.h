// <summary> Iterate an IPosition through the shape of an Array </summary>
//
// ArrayPositionIterator manipulates an IPosition "cursor" through some
// volume defined by an origin and shape. This position can in turn be
// used to index into, or otherwise define a position in, an Array. Normally
// users won't use this class directly, rather they will use an ArrayIterator,
// VectorIterator or MatrixIterator object, which in turn uses this class.
// ArrayPositionIterator is also used in the implementation of Array.
//
// <srcblock>
// template<class T> void verySlowArrayCopy(Array<T> &to, const Array<T> &from)
// {
//     if (! to.conform(from)) {
//        // throw some error
//     }
//     ArrayPositionIterator toiter(to.shape(), to.origin(),0);
//     ArrayPositionIterator fromiter(from.shape(), from.origin(),0);
//     // If to.origin() == from.origin() we only need one iterator
//     // or we could offset positions by the difference in origins.
//     // The "0" means we are stepping by scalars.
//     while (! toiter.pastEnd()) {    // we know arrays conform
//         to(toiter.pos()) = fromiter(fromiter.pos());
//         toiter.next(); fromiter.next();
//     }
// }
// </srcblock>
//
// At the moment this only iterates by the simplest "bottom to top" order, and
// the iteration step always "fills up" its dimensionality. e.g., if we are
// stepping through a cube by matrices, the matrix completely fills up the
// plane. These restrictions should be removed eventually.
//
// <note role=tip> All the array iterator classes should probably be reimplemented;
//        their implementation is a bit ugly.
