// <synopsis>
// This class is meant to encapsulate miscellaneous information about the
// environment that the current process is running in.
// 
// At present, the class can be used to obtain the hostname the process is 
// running on, the process id of this process, and the a count of the number
// of seconds from January 1, 1970. Generally you should use the classes
// <linkto class=Time>Time</linkto> and <linkto class=MVTime>MVTime</linkto> if
// your primary interest is related to time and dates. If your interest is in
// timing, you would generally use class <linkto class=Timer>Timer</linkto>,
// which can also report CPU times as well as "clock" times.
// </synopsis>
//
// <example>
// <srcblock>
// cout << "I am process #" << HostInfo::processID() << " running on host " <<
//         HostInfo::hostName() << endl;
// Double now = HostInfo::secondsFrom1970();
// doSomething();
// cout << "Function doSomething() took " << 
//         HostInfo::secondsFrom1970() - now << " seconds to execute."  << endl;
// </srcblock>
// </example>
//
// <motivation>
// The <linkto class=ObjectID>ObjectID</linkto> class uses a combination of
// hostname, process id, time, and a sequence number to ensure that ObjectID's
// are distinct. This class encapsulates the way the first three of those items
// are obtained.
// </motivation>
//
// <todo asof="1997/10/07">
//   <li> OS version?
//   <li> Physical memory, number of CPU's?
// </todo>
