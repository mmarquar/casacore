 summary:  image.view has improved region handling
When regions are emitted via the image.view() display,
it is now possible to accumulate them and then make
a compound region from the accumulated regions.
this enables you to, say, mask many planes of a cube.

this control is done thorugh a new rollup, 'regions'
