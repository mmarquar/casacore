 summary:  Added conversion to/from STL vector
A conversion from STL vector to aips++ Vector (through a non-explicit constructor); and from any Array to STL vector (through Array::tovector())
was added.
This connection can also be used to go to/from  other sequential STL containers using range constructors.
