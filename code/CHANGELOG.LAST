 summary:  Usability improvements and new functionality

Many changes as suggested by various people:

	- Antennas and baselines entries can be filled in using graphical
widgets.
	- Antenna1 and Antenna2 have disappeared to be replaced just by
Antennas.
	- Editing now works on uvslice plot.
	- Uvslice plots can now be made at n angles at once. 
	- Can now unflag points in the plot-based editing.
	- The color code for polarizations is now plotted.

 summary:  inputsmanager now based on recordmanager

Inputsmanager is now implemented using the new recordmanager. This means
that old inputs tables are no longer accessible from this version
(but are still accessible from old versions).

inputsmanager also now knows to convert itemcontainers to record
before storing. Unfortunately there is no easy automatic way to 
convert them back so currently on restoring the record is left
as is. guientry.genericitem now can convert from these records to
a true itemcontainer so this does not affect toolmanager

 summary:  Recordmanager can save and restore records to a table

recordmanager is a general tool for saving and restoring
records to and from an AIPS++ table. Attributes and
comments are saved along with the record.

This is now used for storing inputs. I also plan to offer
a GUI interface to allow all records to be saved automatically

 summary:  Cleanup of implementation

Toolmanager has been cleaned up internally. It has been split into a
couple of files:

	- toolmanager: public interface that public should see
	- toolmanagersupport: functional interface used by GUIs and CLIs

 summary:  Cleanup of stdtoolguiserver

I've split out the various parts of the GUI into separate files:

	- toolguibasefunction.g: base function used in most toolmanager
guis. Contains autogui, etc.
	- toolguiserver.g: sets up top level guis for tools, functions, etc.
	- toolmanagerguiserver: sets up top level gui for the manager

 summary:  Added antennas and baselines types

I've added two new types: antennas and baselines. These are arrays
that know to use the gopher to get antenna and baseline information.

I've also added a context keyword to the specification of arguments.
The intention is that this propagates to the individual widgets and
provides a wider context e.g. the name of a measurement set that is
being used in the tool. This is work in progress.
