 summary:  added "Mode" facility to the abstract Function interface
The "Mode" facility provides a generic interface for getting and setting
function-specific state outside of the "Parameter" mechanism.  This state
is passed in the form of a Record whose contents are defined by the specific
implementations of the Function.  This is useful for data that do not fit
in well as Parameters, e.g. because they are not of the same type as the 
Range or Domain.  This facility is used by the FunctionHolder class to pass
such special state between C++ and Glish.

Chebyshev was updated to make use of the Mode facility.  The special state
passed in this way includes the interval of interest, the out-of-interval
behavior, and the default value.  

The Mode facility may be replaced with a different mechanism in the future.
